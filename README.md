ADEON is a software solution for controlling GSM devices (GSM gates, relays, modules etc.) via SMS commands. It consists of two main parts:

1. ADEON android mobile app available on Google Play
2. Library for embedded development kits (open-source)

ADEON app allows user to create a list of GSM devices with predefined commands. These commands can be sent in form of SMS message to the target GSM device and thus control its behaviour, e.g. switch on/off a relay, open/close a gate, de/activate alarm etc.

The library for embedded development kits provides user an API for receiving commands from the ADEON app. It is primarily intended for use with Arduino-like boards but can be also easily integrated to other C/C++ projects.
